				A service in progress is the addition of image recognition that would make it easier for users to keep track of food they have, as well as their 
				expiration dates. With the aid of a user's phone or camera, we would be able to process and categorize foods quickly and accurately. In addition,
				we would continue to (as always!) try our best to improve the user experience.
