				A very useful feature that may be next is the addition of image recognition, which would make it easier for users to keep track of food they have, as well as their 
				expiration dates. With the aid of a user's phone or camera, we would be able to process and categorize foods quickly and accurately. In addition,
				we will continue to (as always!) try our best to improve the user experience.
